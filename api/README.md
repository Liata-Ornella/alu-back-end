# 0. Gather data from an API

## Description
This project is about connecting to a REST API and retrieving data about an employeeâ€™s TODO list progress.

The script uses the **JSONPlaceholder** fake REST API to get information about a given employee, such as:
- Their name
- The number of tasks they have completed
- The total number of tasks
- The titles of all completed tasks

The program outputs this information in a clean, formatted way.

## Usage

```bash
./0-gather_data_from_an_API.py <employee_id>
